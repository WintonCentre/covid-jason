Additional Notes
----------------

Notes from [Harry Giles](https://github.com/henryjon):

* `five-year-average.csv` comes from [here][1].
* `adjustment-factor.csv` will not need recalculating. You can consider it a hard-coded value that will not change. It was generated by regressing deaths in the first 10 weeks of 2020 onto the first 10 weeks of 2015-2019.
